# Examples

One runnable file per SDK operation. These are **real, executed code** — not
markdown snippets — so they cannot silently drift from the API.

```bash
npm run examples          # all 14, against a mock transport
node examples/03-sale.mjs # just one
```

## Live mode

The same files run against the real gateway:

```bash
INOVIO_LIVE=1 \
INOVIO_USER=... INOVIO_PASS=... INOVIO_SITE_ID=... INOVIO_MERCH_ACCT_ID=... \
INOVIO_SITE_KEY=...            `# token service HMAC key` \
INOVIO_TOKEN_SITE_ID=...       `# only if tokenizing on a different site` \
npm run examples
```

⚠️ Live mode creates **real transactions**. Point it at a test environment.

Running live is worth doing before you trust an integration: mocks only replay
responses you already believed in, so they cannot catch request-side errors.
Every example here that operates on an existing order builds its own first,
rather than hardcoding an id that resolves only against a mock.

## The files

| File | Operation | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `01-test-availability` | `testAvailability()` | TESTGW — safe to poll |
| `02-test-auth` | `testAuth()` | verify credentials, no transaction |
| `03-sale` | `sale()` | authorize + capture in one step |
| `04-authorize` | `authorize()` | hold funds; keep the `orderRef` |
| `05-capture` | `capture()` | full or partial |
| `06-capture-line-item` | `captureLineItem()` | needs order + item + amount |
| `07-reverse` | `reverse()` | void an authorization |
| `08-reverse-capture` | `reverseCapture()` | void a capture, pre-settlement |
| `09-refund` | `refund()` | return captured funds |
| `10-force-credit` | `forceCredit()` | needs MID provisioning |
| `11-status` | `status()` | reconciliation + net position |
| `12-update-order` | `updateOrder()` | receipts for compliance |
| `13-tokenize` | `tokenize()` | PAN → single-use token |
| `14-timeout-recovery` | — | the pattern that prevents double charges |

## Two that need provisioning

- **`forceCredit`** fails with API 104 "Invalid service action" unless the MID
  has FORCE_CREDIT enabled. That is an `AuthenticationError`, not a decline.
- **`tokenize`** needs a per-site HMAC key from Inovio support. It is not your
  gateway password.
